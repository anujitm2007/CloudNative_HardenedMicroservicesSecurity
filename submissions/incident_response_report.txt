1. Incident commander name:
Anuj Sharma

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods with three different crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) were launched on our kubernetes cluster.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of our kubernetes cluster and run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) containers on the cluster. Attackers are after compute resources to abuse for crypto-mining.

4. Summary of the impact:
The attacker managed to run crypto miners (minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet) on our kubernetes cluster, which is undesirable. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU. The CPU usage jumps into 99% utilization, which impacts all services' performance on the cluster. This also means the attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run these containers on the cluster. The Kubernetes/compute resources dashboard in Grafana shows the significant spike in CPU utilization, this is related to the crypto miners being started.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
>> Our administrator ran the following command to evict the crypto miner pods:
"kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>".  This evicted the miner pods and CPU utilization fell to the pre-incident levels as the crypto mining pods are evicted.

>> All access credentials to the kubernetes credentials are being rotated/refreshed, this is a precautionary measure given the attacker was able to run the pods and therefore would have had access to an administrative terminal, kube config file or UI.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
>> One must use the monitoring tools like grafana
>> Should make admission controllers to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
